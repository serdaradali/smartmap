- Switch to detailed topojson within a city takes longer than usual.
	* Needs mouseover for regions to be visible
	** FIXED Watch was not working for choropleth object values, broadcast used instead.

+ Point distance to polygon center seems to be wrong
	* d3.geo.centroid & d3.geo.bounds are not reliable.
	** FIXED using d3.bounds and Leaflet.getCenter()

- YELP api sometimes returns 404
	When list is refreshed for one region, clicking other region throws error

- Filter does not work sometimes

+ On click region does not work on the first click
	** FIXED: This was due to the default value of selectedDivisionIndex
